    "In my neighborhood, it's very difficult to find a bookstore, office products and scholar items like a paper, pens, erasers, folders, set of colors, etc, We have in Montreal very good stores, but there are far away from here. A business opportunity appears because many people don't want to move to downtown or cross the river to go south and the most important, it's not funny to take the bus or car at 19 hours trying to finding paper for the printer. Then I take advantage of this, the necessity creates a solution."
