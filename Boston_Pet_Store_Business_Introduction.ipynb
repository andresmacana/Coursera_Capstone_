    "In this time people are worried about pets, from spiders to horses, and now that people spend more time in social media, many of them decide to have a pet friend. The problem in many cities is access to the pet store, sometimes are far away from home. In this case, I'm not only want to analyze where the pet store is, but I also want to add two components, a coffee shop and a pizza place. Why? Because I think that the most popular venues can help to develop a new business helping with a big flux of people. "

And on the other side, the people want a place close home where to find the important things for their pets. We have the necessity of society and we can contribute to this gap.  "
